#  Build the Perfect Team:
How to bulid the perfect team ?
What about the people whithin one team ?
Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests?should they have the same hobbies or educational backgrounds?
 
After a lot of cherches, the result was: there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference.
## group norms
Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather

Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team
### To have a good team :
1. members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment
2. all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
