# HTML 
Why we use HTML ?
HTML Describes the Structure of Pages using elementes * Each
element has an opening tag and a closing tag*, we add code to the words we want
to appear on the page.
* Opening tag *<Character >*  .... The characters in the brackets
indicate the tag's purpose. 
* closing tag *</Character>*
* <p Attribute Name="Attribute Value">  ....Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element.
 They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
* Anything written between the <title> tags will appear in the title bar (or tabs) at the top of the browser window.
* Anything written between the <body> tags will appear in the main browser window.
*  Comments in HTML *<!-- comment goes here -->*
We use comment in HTML to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser.
* Class Attribute .... Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements
as being different from the other elements on the page.
* Block Elements ....Some elements will always appear to start on a new line inthe browser window.
 These are known as block level elements.
* Inline Elements ....Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.
These are known as inline elements.


## Extra Markup
Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML.
Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).
* HTML 4
* XHTML 1.0
* HTML5
##### DOCTYPE 
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML
the page is using.

There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets.)

# HTML5 Layout
The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

# PROCESS & Design

It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

You can differentiate between pieces of information using 
* size
* color 
* style. 

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
Good navigation tends to follow these principles
* Concise
* Clear
* Selective

# JavaScript

## The ABC of Programming:

### What is a script and how do I create one?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
1: DEFINE THE GOAL 
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3: CODE EACH STEP 

**SKETCHING OUT THE TASKS IN A FLOWCHART**
Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations.
You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together. 

### How do computers fit in with the world around them?
Computers use data to create models of things in the real world. The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other:
Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties. 

Using the document object, you can access and change what content users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it. 


### How do I write a script for a web page? 
* HTML : CONTENT LAYER
* CSS : PRESENTATION LAYER
* JS : BEHAVIOR LAYER

*You should link the CSS and JS files in to HTML index*You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags
(but it is better to put scripts in their own files)
