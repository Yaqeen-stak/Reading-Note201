How Forms Work?!
A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.
*Form Structure*
`Form`
Form controls live inside a
`<form>` element. This element
should always carry the `action`
attribute and will usually have a
`method` and `id` attribute too

You have probably seen forms
on the web that give users
messages if the form control has
not been filled in correctly; this is
known as **form validation.**

# Events:

### HOW EVENTS TRIGGER
JAVASCRIPT CODE?

1. Select the element
node(s) you want the
script to respond to. 
2. Indicate which event on
the selected node(s) will
trigger the response. 
3. State the code you want
to run when the event
occurs. 
###  WAYS TO BIND AN
EVENT TO AN ELEM ENT 
1. HTML EVENT
HANDLERS 
2. TRADITIONAL DOM
EVENT HANDLERS 
3. DOM LEVEL 2 EVENT
LISTENERS 
(Event listeners are a more recent approach to handling events.
They can deal with more than one function at a time
but they are not supported in older browsers. )

** you cannot have parentheses after the
function names in event handlers or listeners**
so,passing arguments requires a workaround. !

#### THE EVENT OBJECT

When an event occurs, the event object tells
you information about the event, and the
element it happened upon. 

When calling a function, the event object's target property is the best
way to determine which element the event occurred on
 TYPES
OF EVENTS:
1. W3C DOM EVENTS 
2.HTM LS EVENTS 
3.BOM EVENTS 
4.LOAD 
5.FOCUS & BLUR EVENTS 

6.MOUSE EVENTS 

7.KEYBOARD EVENTS 

8.Whenever elements are added to or removed from the DOM, its
structure changes. This change triggers a *mutation event*. 

The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.
