# HTML 
## Images :
Using images very useful for the site and this will improve it .
 It is good practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.
To add an image into the page
you need to use an `<img>`
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
1. src
2. alt
You can also use the `title`
attribute with the `<img>` element
to provide additional information
about the image
**Also** we can use height and width element 
 Yoi can place the img. where ever you want .
Where you place the image in
the code is important because
browsers show HTML elements
in one of two ways:
* Block elements always appear
on a new line
* Inline elements sit within a
block level element and do not
start on a new line.
##### Align
The `align` attribute was
commonly used to indicate how
the other parts of a page should
flow around an image.
 **we can align img.**
horizontally using (left ,rigt)
virtically using (top,bottom,middle) 
###  Rules for
Creating Images:
* Save images in
the right format
* Save images at
the right size
* Use the correct
resolution
 we use ` Adobe
Photoshop`
to  edit and
save images to ensure that they are the right
size, format, and resolution.
*Use **GIF** or **PNG** format
when saving images
with few colors or large
areas of the same color.*

Animated GIFs show several frames of an
image in sequence and therefore can be used to
create simple animations.
###  Figure and
Figure Caption:
Figure:
Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new `<figure>` element to
contain images and their caption
Figure Caption:
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.
*You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format*
*imgs. are best saved as JPEGs*

## Color:
If you want to maake your page full of life .. you have to use colors .
Foreground Color : we use `color`
Background Color : we use `Backgroung-color` 
** You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:**
1. rgb values LIKE rgb(102,205,170)
2. hex codes LIKE #66cdaa
3. color names LIKE MediumAquaMarine

**Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.**

When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.
### Opacity : 
`opacity, rgba`
allows you to
specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).

CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using
* hue .(In HSL colors, hue is often
represented as a color circle
where the angle represents the
color)
* saturation .(Saturation is the amount of
gray in a color)
* lightness values .(Lightness is the amount of
white (lightness) or black
(darkness) in a color)
