What markup means ?
It's the tags that added to the contents of the page you want to create. 
- There is two types of markup:
1. **Structural markup** :

* *Headings* .... (h1,h2,....,h6)
* *Paragraphs* 
* *Bold* 
* *Italic*
* *Superscrip*
* *Subscrip*
* *Line Breaks*
* *Horizontal Rules* 

2. **Semantic markup** :

To add extra information to the pages.
* *strong*
* *em*
* *blockquote*
* *q*
* *address*
* *abbr* ....Abbreviations & Acronyms

# CSS
Cascading Style Sheets 
is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
a CSS rulles contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.(the details shown below)

![CSS Rules](https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2014/11/18/9461/012655e623bef579c9bd376e227bc648/css-declaration-small.png)

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

We can use the CSS in three ways :
1. Inline style 
2. Internal style:

WE can include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element inside the <head> element of the page .

3. **External style**:

 it's the most recommended type .
but, we should add a CSS file link inside the <head> element of the page.
 
#  JavaScript

JS is a **BEHAVIOR LAYER**
 ### How can i run the JS?
Firt you should create a file with (.JS extension) and then add the link for this file inside the <Body> element in the index of HTML code.

#### What is the statement?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one, Each individual instruction or step is statement .

*Note* Use comments to help you (/…../) to expline what the code do !


#### Whate is the variables?
It’s a space in memory that store data of any type (numerical,string or boolean). We can declared the varible by : Var any thing= ;
JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name. You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it

var <variable-name> = <value>;
the **Value** can be NUMBER,STRINGES OR BOOLEAN.

**BOOLEAN DATA TYPE** can have one of two values: true or false. 
*SO* we can use If-esle statment.

##### We have four types og operators :
* Arithmetic Operator
* String Operator
* Logical Operator
* Comparison Operator


## Decisions and Loops :
JS have to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs,Flowchart can help with that .
If statment is an example .

##### Operatores :

* *==*  is equal to ----> comperse 2 values to check if they are the same
* *===*  is strict equal to ----> comperse 2 values to check if both *Data type* and *Value* are the same 
* *!=*  is not equal to  ----> comperse 2 values to check if they are *not* the same
* *!==*    is strict Not equal to ----> comperse 2 values to check if both *Data type* and *Value* are *not* the same 
* *>*   is greater than  ----> chech if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right .
* *<*  is less than ---->  chech if the number on the left is less than the number on the right .
* *>=*  is greater than or equal ---->  chech if the number on the left is greater than or equal the number on the right .
* *<=*  is less than or equal ----> chech if the number on the left is less than or equal the number on the right .

##### Logical Operators :

Allow u to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
Like 
* AND (&&) 
* OR (||) 
* NOT (!) 


### Loop
#### For loop : to run the code specific number of times .

#### While loop :
when u don’t know how many times the code will run.

#### Do While loop :
it will always run the statments inside the curly braces at least ones even it’s false .
